# Proof of Reputation: A Soulbound NFT Based on Private Social Interactions

The **Proof of Reputation** project leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology** to create a dynamic soulbound NFT (SBT) that represents a user's reputation in the Web3 ecosystem. This project innovatively combines private social interactions and on-chain behaviors to form a unique, encrypted representation of a user's digital identity.

## Why Reputation Matters

In today's digital landscape, reputation can make or break a user's experience across platforms. However, traditional systems often compromise user privacy and security. Users are left vulnerable to public scrutiny and potential misuse of their personal data when establishing their online identities. The Proof of Reputation project addresses these challenges by providing a private, secure, and dynamic way to represent user reputation without exposing sensitive information.

## The Power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology is at the heart of the Proof of Reputation project. By utilizing Zama's open-source libraries, we can compute reputation scores based on encrypted user behavior data - such as governance voting and received ratings - while keeping all interactions confidential. This not only ensures that sensitive information remains private, but also allows users to generate zero-knowledge proofs regarding their reputation without revealing their underlying data. This implementation harnesses the potential of Zama's libraries, such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, to revolutionize how we perceive and establish identities in decentralized networks.

## Core Functionalities

- **FHE Encryption of User Behavior Data**: All user interactions and behaviors are encrypted using Zama's advanced FHE technology to maintain privacy.
- **Dynamic Reputation Scoring**: The reputation score evolves based on interactions, computed through homomorphic operations while keeping the data confidential.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: Users can create verifiable proofs of their reputation without disclosing the specifics of their interactions.
- **Trustworthy Decentralized Identity**: Establishes a reliable digital identity system, resilient against traditional pitfalls, that respects user privacy.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDKs**: Utilizing Zama’s fully homomorphic encryption libraries for confidential computing.
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Deployed using Solidity for creating NFTs and managing reputation scores.
- **Node.js**: For backend services and interaction with the Ethereum network.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development environment for compiling and testing smart contracts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Proof of Reputation project, follow these setup instructions. Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat or Foundry installed on your machine.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Download the project files** to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including Zama's libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Make sure not to use `git clone` or any URLs.

## Build and Run the Project

After the dependencies are installed, you can compile and run the project by executing the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Compile the smart contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests** to ensure everything works correctly:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the smart contract** to your desired network:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Code Example

Here's a simple code snippet demonstrating how to generate a dynamic reputation score based on user interactions using Zama's FHE. This will illustrate the essence of our project.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ZamaFHE.sol"; // Hypothetical import for Zama's FHE library

contract Proof_Of_Reputation {
    mapping(address => uint256) private reputationScores;

    function updateReputation(address user, uint256 newScore) external {
        // Here we would normally utilize Zama's FHE to handle scores securely
        reputationScores[user] = ZamaFHE.homomorphicAdd(reputationScores[user], newScore);
    }

    function getReputation(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
        return reputationScores[user];
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we provide a basic framework for updating and retrieving user reputation scores while hinting at how Zama's technology securely integrates into the smart contract.
